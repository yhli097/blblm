Title: Linear Regression with Little Bag of Bootstraps by Parallel and Rcpp
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Yahui Li, Randy Lai
Maintainer: Yahui Li <yhli@ucdavis.edu>
Description: This is the final project of STA 141C 2020 Spring. The goal is to implement 
    little bag of bootstrap in linear regression, to get the estimation as well as 
    confidence interval of coefficients, sigma and prediction. In order to speed up,
    I use the parallel package to make parallel computation. Users can set up clusters 
    and apply it in this process. Also, I provide method to help users distribute files 
    into clusters to reduce the physical memory. What is more, users can choose method 
    in linear regression like lm, lmR and lmC. The last one is a C++ function which allows
    a faster computation.
